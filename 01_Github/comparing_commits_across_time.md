### [Comparing commits across time](https://help.github.com/articles/comparing-commits-across-time/)
> Every repository contains a Compare view, which allows you to compare the state of your repository across `branches`, `tags`, `commits`, `time periods`, and more. 

> The compare view provides you with the same diff tooling that the Pull Request view does.

To get to the compare view, `append /compare` to your repository's path.

We'll demonstrate the power of Compare by looking at the compare page for a fork of the Linguist repo, which is at https://github.com/octocat/linguist/compare/master...octocat:master.

Every repository's Compare view contains two drop down menus: base and compare.
